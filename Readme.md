hi  there,

welcome oon board to learn bhailang.
it's a all new language based on typescript.

so let's learn about it's systax and other commands

starting the program by writing

``  hi bhai  

    //code goes here

    bye bhai

``


to assign the value of a variable we can do,
``
 bhai ye hai a = 100;    //declaring a value to a variable [number]
   bhai ye hai b = 10 + (15*20); //declaring a value to a variable [multiple number]
   bhai ye hai c = "one"; //declaring a value to a variable [string]
   bhai ye hai d = 'ok'; //declaring a value to a variable [character]
   bhai ye hai e = nalla; //declaring a value to a variable [null]
   bhai ye hai f = sahi; //declaring a value to a variable [true]
   bhai ye hai g = galat; //declaring a value to a variable [false]
``

if you wanna print anything like you did in javascript you can do,

`` bol bhai "HI Farhan Speaking";   // to printing a string ``

if you go with condition rending do the follwing:

``
  //  conditional rendering
    bhai ye hai h = 10;
    agar bhai (h < 20) {
    bol bhai "h is less than 20";
  } nahi to bhai ( h < 25 ) {
    bol bhai "h is less than 25";
  } warna bhai {
    bol bhai "h is greater than or equal to 25";
  }

  ``

finally og ay programming language loops is essential, in bhailang you can do the following to do the works of loops

``
 //loops start here

    bhai ye hai i = 0;
    jab tak bhai (i < 10) {
    i += 1;
    agar bhai (i == 5) {
    bol bhai "andar se bol bhai ", i;
    agla dekh bhai;
    }
    agar bhai (i == 6) {
    bas kar bhai;
    }
    bol bhai i;
    }
    bol bhai "done";
